# Introduction to Python and Programming

## Description

This unit is dedicated to people who are having a first contact with coding world. We recommend different materials to begin learning Python, so you can see what better fits with your learning style. One option is this [free gamified course from SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1157). Another good material is [this YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dlKP6QQCekuIPky1CiwmdI6) on Python basics. For you to start using Python on your machine, we strongly recommend to [download Anaconda and use the Spyder IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP4D-yaxw6E) to code and run your programms (this is a more beginner-friendly setup).

When you feel more comfortable with programming and Python, carry out the **Proposed Projects** described below.


## Proposed Projects:

We propose 3 different projects that will require to use different basic concepts of the Python programming language. The projects grow in difficulty so it's best to start with the first one. We recommend to write and run the project using the Spyder IDE as mentioned previously.

1. [Birthday Dictionary](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/24/33-birthday-dictionaries.html)

2. [Palindrome Detector](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/12/06-string-lists.html)

3. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/26/08-rock-paper-scissors.html)
