# Introduction to Python and Programming

## Description

This unit is dedicated to people who are having a first contact with coding world. We recommend different materials to begin learning Python, so you can see what better fits with your learning style. One option is this [free gamified course from SoloLearn](). Other good materials are these YouTube video series: [](). For you to start using Python on your machine, we strongly recommend to [download Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) and [use the Spyder IDE]() to code and run your programms (this is a more begginer-friendly setup).

When you feel more comfortable with programming and Python, carry out the **Proposed Projects** (located at the end of this README).
