# Introduction to Python and Programming

## Introduction

This unit is dedicated to people who are having a first contact with coding world. We recommended some series of videos for leaning the programming basics and the Python basics. After watching the videos and feeling more comfortable with programming and Python, some small projects are proposed. 

Finally, write a report with the results. For this report use the LaTeX template present on this repo (`.tex` and `.bib` files).

**NOTE:** We strongly recommended to begginers download Anaconda and use the Spyder IDE.
