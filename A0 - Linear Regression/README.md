# Linear Regression with Perceptron

## Proposed problem

For this activity we will create a linear prediction model to estimate the temperature based on salinity data. Implement a linear regression using a simple perceptron model with linear activation. Watch the first seven videos of [this series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4) and follow along the Jupyter Notebook of this repository (`.ipynb`). For this activity, we will use the dataset from Kaegle listed on the Dataset section. Note that, only two columns of the bottle.csv dataset are used (Salinity and T_degC). See the Support Material section for guidelines on complementary materials.

Finally, write a report with the results. For this report use the LaTeX template present on this repo (`.tex` and `.bib` files).

**NOTE:** You will have to download the dataset on your machine! Follow the README instructions of the `/_data` folder of this repo.
