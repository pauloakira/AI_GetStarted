# Pandas and Data Manipulation

## Proposed problem

For this activity we will manipulate a real data file, executing some basic functionalities of the Pandas library from Python.
For a general understanding of the library and it's functionalities, watch [this series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS). The dataset that will be used on this activity is available here on this project folder, or can be directly downloaded via [Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/juttugarakesh/video-game-data).

Your task is to create a jupyter notebook, load the database, treat the data and save it to a file with the name: `treated_game_data.xlsx`. This file must contain only games that have critic score above 70 or user score above 7. The information that is desired is only: name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, critic score and user score. If any missing data are present after filtering, remove their rows.
